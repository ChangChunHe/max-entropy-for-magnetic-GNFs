# max entropy for magnetic graphene nanoflakes (GNFs)
- Determing the optimal electron and spin density for magnetic GNFs.


- This is a MATLAB code, which aims to find the optimal occupancy number for GNF molecules, ``filename`` is the molecule file written in VASP-format, and the ``x`` is the optimal value and ``y`` is the maximum entropy, ``all_atom_ele`` is the unpaired electrons in each carbon atom.
